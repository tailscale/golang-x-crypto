# golang-x-crypto

This is a temporary dev fork of Go's `golang.org/x/crypto` module,
but only for `ssh` development.

The only thing expected to work is `go test ./ssh/...`. Other packages
will have broken package references.

# Contributing

PRs not welcome here. This is where we temporarily put patches we're
working on getting upstream ourselves.
